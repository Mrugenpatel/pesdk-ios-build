## 8.1.3

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where `FrameToolControllerOptions.cellConfigurationClosure` would not be called.

## 8.1.2

### Fixed

* Fixed a crash when narrowing the text bounding box while zoomed in on the image.

## 8.1.1

### Added

* Added haptic feedback for supported devices.
* Added class replacement support for `StickerImageView`, `FrameImageView`, `SpriteLabel`, `Painting` and `CanvasView`.

### Changed

* Made the `BrushSpriteModel` initializers public.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where custom fonts would not be loaded.
* Fixed an issue where sticker and sticker category thumbnails would sometimes have lower resolution.

## 8.1.0

### Added

* Added the possibility to change a sticker's brightness, contrast and saturation. Take a look at `Sticker.allowBrightnessAdjustment`, `Sticker.allowContrastAdjustment`, `Sticker.allowSaturationAdjustment` and `StickerAction.brightness`, `StickerAction.contrast`, `StickerAction.saturation` for more details.
* iPhone X support for `CameraViewController`.
* Added `TextToolControllerOptions.dimmingViewConfigurationClosure`.

### Changed

* `Font` expects an `URL` instead of a `String` now.

### Fixed

* Fixed a misplaced title view on iOS 9 when embedding the `PhotoEditViewController` inside a `UINavigationController`.
* `StickerToolController` displays the currently selected sticker category as its title again.
* The color picker's saturation and brightness picker updates as expected now when saturation is set to 0 and the user drags the hue picker.
* `ColorPickerViewController` and `FontSelectorViewController` didn't call `addChildViewController(_:)` and `didMove(toParentViewController:)` for their contained `SpriteEditController`, resulting in layout issues.

## 8.0.1

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where static frames would not be shown.
* Made `PhotoEditViewController.init(photo:data:configuration:menuItems:photoEditModel:)` public to enable subclassing `PhotoEditViewController`.
* Fixed new warnings generated by Xcode 9.1 beta.
* Fixed a bug where undo and redo would not work correctly when drawing out of bounds within the brush tool.

## 8.0.0

### Added

* Full support for iOS 11 and Swift 4.
* Added rotation gesture support to `FrameToolController` (disabled by default).
* Added serialization format v3.0.0, which can be used to serialize and deserialize edits across all platforms.
* Added support for the iPhone X to `PhotoEditViewController`.

### Changed

* Completely refactored the sprite handling code. Sprites (stickers, text, brush and frames) are now directly rendered on top of the image instead of rendering a view snapshot. This results in better looking images, better performance and more robust code.
* Completely refactored `PhotoEditViewController` and all `PhotoEditToolController` subclasses. We make heavy use of composition and container view controllers now, leading to better support for customizations and custom user interfaces.
* All view controllers and views can be replaced by a custom subclass using `PESDK.replaceClass(_:with:)` for even better customization options.
* Undo and redo is now supported by all tools. The sticker, text and brush tools continue to have a local undo/redo stack in addition to the global undo/redo stack.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where the selected crop rectangle would change after tapping the apply button in the transform tool.
* Fixed an issue where focus would change its appearance and position after transform.
* Fixed an issue where the color saturation and brightness picker would sometimes not update while dragging the hue picker.
* The `PhotoEditViewController` can now be pushed onto a navigation controller that uses a translucent navigation bar.
* Fixed various layout issues with the transform and frame tools.
* Fixed a crash when quickly switching between a sticker and text.

### Removed

* Removed the transparent color from the default color palette for text color and brush color.
* The `ToolbarController` class has been removed. An instance of `PhotoEditViewController` can now be used directly.

## 7.3.0

* Fixed a layout issue in tool controllers when zooming is disabled.
* Fixed a memory issue while deserializing.
* Fixed an issue in the transform tool where the selected crop rectangle would sometimes not match the actual crop rectangle.
* Fixed an issue with the image renderer emitting a warning.

### Deprecated

* Serialization version 2.0.0 has been deprecated in this release and will not be supported by future versions of the SDK. Please use PhotoEditor SDK 8.0 with serialization version 3.0.0 instead.

## 7.2.0

### Added

* `PhotoEditViewController` has a new property called `hasChanges`, which is `true` if a user applied any changes to a photo.
* `StickerToolControllerOptions` has a new property called `defaultStickerCategoryIndex` that can be used to specify the index of the initially selected sticker category.
* All `UICollectionViewCell` subclasses can be replaced with custom subclasses using `Configuration`'s `replaceClass(_:replacingClass:moduleName:)` method.

### Changed

* `TransformToolController` now sends a `.transformStraightenAngleChange` analytics event for changes of the straighten angle.
* `TransformToolController` now includes `.cropRect`, `.straightenAngle` and `.aspectRatio` attributes in its `.applyChanges` analytics event.
* When adding or removing a sticker a `.stickerAdd` or `.stickerRemove` analytics event is sent with the associated sticker as a `.sticker` attribute. Those events are also sent when adding or removing a sticker by tapping the undo/redo buttons.
* When adding or removing text a `.textAdd` or `.textRemove` analytics event is sent with the associated text as a `.text` attribute. Those events are also sent when adding or removing text by tapping the undo/redo buttons.
* `TextOptionsToolController` now includes `.text`, `.font`, `.textColor`, `.backgroundColor` and `.alignment` attributes in its `.applyChanges` analytics event.

## 7.1.1

### Added

* `CameraViewControllerOptions` includes a `includeUserLocation` property now that is `true` by default. It can be used to stop the camera from asking for the user's location.

### Changed

* `LoggerProtocol` is now a `class` protocol because loggers are required to be reference types in the current implementation.

### Fixed

* Fixed several smaller bugs regarding deserialization.
* Sometimes the cropping area would be resized while modifying the straighten angle.
* Memory is not copied twice anymore during painting fragment restoration.
* The project compiles with Xcode 9 now.

## 7.1.0

### Added

* The camera tags photos with their location now. This only works when using `Data` instances instead of `UIImage` instances to pass the photo around because those strip EXIF data. See `CameraViewController.dataCompletionBlock` for more details.
* We added a default confirmation dialog when dismissing the editor with changes pending. This can be changed or disabled by setting `PhotoEditViewControllerOptions.discardConfirmationClosure`.

### Changed

* The preview image is now automatically resized when a slider overlays the preview at the bottom, so that is always completely visible.
* We replaced the gaussian blur used in the focus tool with a lens blur like effect for much better looking photos. This does not work on the following older devices where we continue to use a gaussian blur due to performance issues:
	* iPad mini 1st, 2nd and 3rd gen
	* iPad 2nd and 3rd gen
	* iPhone 4S
	* iPod touch

### Fixed

* Fixed various issues with the serialization and deserialization features.
* Fixed an issue with different color spaces used for the preview and the thumbnails in the filter tool.
* Stickers now use anti-aliasing.
* The icon of the 'No Frame' cell in the frame tool is now tinted with the cell's `tintColor` to better match other cells.
* The label of the 'Magic' cell in the main menu is now tinted with the cell's `tintColor` when highlighted to better match other cells.
* The `Slider` now sends a `.touchUpInside` event after a `.touchDown` event has been sent without dragging in between.
* When adding a frame to a photo it would sometimes not completely cover the preview image (by about 1 px).
* When selecting a sticker with its `tintMode` set to `.none` and then dismissing the `StickerOptionsToolController`, the color option would be visible for a split second during the dismissal animation.
* The `BoxGradientView` and `CircleGradientView` now only draw themselves while visible, resulting in a minor performance improvement.
* Sprites didn't have the correct position for a split second when opening the frame tool.
* Sprites would be rotated in the wrong direction when the photo has been flipped.
* Text bounding box resizing would be inverted if the image has been flipped and rotated.

## 7.0.1

### Added

* Added the ability to zoom using a pinch gesture within the `CameraViewController`.

### Fixed

* The icon of the 'No Overlay' option in the overlay tool was not using its @2x and @3x variants.
* Fixed a bug with the new filters and adjustments.
* Fixed interface rotation support.

## 7.0

### Changed

* **The SDK has been renamed from `imglyKit` to `PhotoEditorSDK` and all class prefixes have been renamed from `IMGLY` to `PESDK`. Likewise the CocoaPod has been renamed to `PhotoEditorSDK`.**
* We now ship the framework as a DMG file and include the dSYM file and bcsymbolmaps for better debugging. To integrate the dSYM into your final app, please follow the [updated manual integration guide](http://docs.photoeditorsdk.com/guides/ios/v7_1/introduction/getting_started).
* The `PESDK.shared` singleton has been removed. All of its properties are now static properties on the `PESDK` class.
* The default progress view must be set using the static `PESDK.progressView` property instead of the `Configuration` closure.

* Custom stickers are now added by setting `Sticker.all`, custom fonts are added by setting `FontImporter.all`, custom frames are added by setting `Frame.all` and custom overlays are added by setting `Overlay.all` instead of using the `Configuration` class.

### Added

* Serialization and deserialization has been added. Because of this many classes (e.g. `Sticker`, `Frame`) now require an `identifier`. For more information please see the documentation.
* The `OverlayToolController` tool has been added, which can be used to add overlays to a photo. Please see the documentation for more information.
* A custom logger with varying log levels was added. See documentation for more information.
* The `Sticker` class now supports `.colorized` as its `tintMode`. See the API documentation for more information.
* A 3:2 crop aspect has been added to `TransformToolController`'s defaults.
* An Emoticon and a Shapes sticker set has been added.
* `TextFontToolControllerOptions` now has a `fontSelectorViewConfigurationClosure` property and a `handleButtonConfigurationClosure` property for better customization.

* Full accessibility support has been restored.

## 6.5.4

### Changed

* With the color picker expanded you can now tap anywhere above it to dismiss the color picker.
* We restored iOS 8 compatibility in this release. Please note that this only means that the framework can be integrated into a target with iOS 8 as its deployment target. However most classes and especially all view controllers are *not* available on iOS 8. We strongly advise that you disable any editing functions for users running iOS 8.

## 6.5.3

### Changed

* We replaced the set of included fonts with much better looking fonts.

* Zooming is now enabled in all tools except for the focus tool.

### Changed

* The overlay buttons (i.e. undo, redo, etc.) in the sticker, text and brush tool have been moved to the bottom.
* `StickerTintMode.tint` has been renamed to `StickerTintMode.solid`.
* `StickerTintMode.ink` has been renamed to `StickerTintMode.colorized`.
* When adding long text the created label breaks the text into multiple lines if the font size would be too small otherwise.

* Support for wide color images. More information is available [here](https://medium.com/imgly/bringing-wide-color-to-photoeditor-sdk-a6ce8bb19ef7#.1nw0egenf).
* Added redo support and optimized undo support. Each time the sticker, text or brush tool is openend, a new undo/redo stack is created and local changes within those tools can be un- and redone. The `PhotoEditViewController` also has support for undo and redo and performs all undo or redo operations of the tools mentioned above combined, either step by step or tool by tool (see `PhotoEditViewControllerOptions.undoStepByStep`).

### Changed

* `M_PI` has been replaced by `.pi`, `FLT_EPSILON` has been replaced by `.ulpOfOne`
* Adding a new sticker from within the `StickerOptionsToolController` now opens the already instantiated `StickerToolController` that was passed to `PhotoEditViewController` instead of creating a new instance.
* The blur radius specified in the `FocusToolController` is now relative to the smaller side of the image instead of an absolute value, which means that the final output image looks like the preview image.

### Fixed

* Fixed a crash that occurred when setting `CameraViewControllerOptions.showFilters` to `false`.

## 6.1.4

### Fixed

* Fixed a crash in `CameraViewController`.
* The `photoActionButtonConfigurationClosure` closure was not called initially.

### Fixed

* Fixed a memory leak in `CameraViewController`.
* Fixed a memory leak in `FrameToolController`.
* Fixed a scaling issue for backdrop images.
* Fixed the Podspec so that the resource bundle is not added twice to projects that use CocoaPods to integrate the SDK.

## 6.1.2

### Added

* A new API to integrate the SDK into your analytics. See `AnalyticsClient` and `PESDK.shared.analytics` for more details.

## 6.0.1

### Added

* Licensing

## 6.0

### Added

* Stickers can be grouped into individual categories and their color can be changed by the user.
* New initializers for `PhotoEditViewController`: `init(data: Data)`, `init(data: Data, configuration: Configuration)` and `init(data: Data, menuItems: [MenuItem], configuration: Configuration)` which allow passing an image as data in which case EXIF information can be preserved.
* `PhotoEditModel` is a Swift `struct` now. When using Objective-C you can use `IMGLYBoxedPhotoEditModel` instead where needed.
